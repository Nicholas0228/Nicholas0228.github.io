This paper introduces FineXtract, a framework for extracting training data from fine-tuned diffusion models shared online. By approximating the model's distribution shift during fine-tuning and using clustering techniques, FineXtract can extract data with high quality, demonstrating potential risks of data leakage and copyright infringement.
